E-Commerce Text Classification<br>

This project focuses on classifying e-commerce product descriptions into categories by implementing robust text preprocessing and machine learning techniques.<br>

Steps Performed:<br>
Data Loading: Loaded a dataset containing thousands of e-commerce product descriptions.<br>
Text Preprocessing:<br>
Removed HTML tags, numbers, special characters, and punctuation.<br>
Tokenized and lemmatized text.<br>
Converted all text to lowercase for uniformity.<br>
Reconstructed cleaned text into a string format.<br>
Text to Numeric Conversion:<br>
Used CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer to transform text data into numerical features.<br>
Model Building:<br>
Trained a Random Forest Classifier.<br>
Achieved a 97% cross-validation accuracy using both vectorization techniques.<br>
Results:<br>
This project demonstrates how efficient text preprocessing and robust model building can lead to high-performing classifiers in the e-commerce domain.<br>
